# Simple Ruby Profiler 
### Simpler than you're lazy
---
## What it does?
It helps you find why your Rails app is terrible slow.

## O_o How do I use it?
```ruby
st = SimpleProfiler.new
st.start
slow_method(tons, of, parameters)
st.stop
Rails.logger.info("report=#{st.report}")
```
```log
report={:steps=>[{:caller=>"/app/controllers/some_controller.rb:5:in slow_action", :time=>3.141516}]}
```

## Do you have more examples?
Look that from [other example](https://github.com/gabrsar/SimpleRubyTracer/blob/master/tracer-test/app/controllers/application_controller.rb):
