# Simple Ruby Profiler 
### Simpler than you're lazy
---
## What it does?
It helps you find why your Rails app is terrible slow.

## O_o How do I use it?
```ruby
sp = SimpleProfiler.new
sp.start
slow_method(tons, of, parameters)
sp.stop
puts("report=#{sp.report}")
```
```log
report={:steps=>[{:caller=>"/your_ruby_file.rb:5:in simple_test", :time=>3.141516}]}
```

## Do you have more examples?
